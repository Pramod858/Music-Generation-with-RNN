# Music Generation with RNN

This is a project that generates music using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The project uses Python and TensorFlow to build a model that learns patterns in music data and generates new music based on those patterns.

##Getting Started
###Prerequisites

Before running the project, you need to have the following installed on your computer:

- Python (version 3.x)
- TensorFlow (version 2.x)
